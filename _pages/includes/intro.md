I am currently at [Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Soochow University](http://scst.suda.edu.cn/), advised by [Assoc. Prof. Juntao Li (李俊涛)](https://lijuntaopku.github.io/) and [Prof. Min Zhang(张民)](https://zhangminsuda.github.io/).

I received my Bachelor’s degreefrom Soochow University (Outstanding Graduate) in 2021 majoring in software engineering. 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, especially in neural machine translation, non-autoregressive methods, efficient text generation, and pre-trained language models. I have published several papers at the top international AI conferences such as AAAI, ICLR, EMNLP.
